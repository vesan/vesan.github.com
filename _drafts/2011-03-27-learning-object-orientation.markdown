* DHH tweeted few tweets
* Shared list of three books
* I had just started to read one of the books in the list
* I found Destroy All Software by the dude, subscribed and watched all the videos
* It's good thing we have this one resource but I hope there will be more
* The more I develop software, it's less about learning the tools but learning to use the tools right

* DHH tweeted few tweets
* Shared list of three books
* I had just started to read one of the books in the list
* I found Destroy All Software by the dude, subscribed and watched all the videos
* It's good thing we have this one resource but I hope there will be more
* The more I develop software, it's less about learning the tools but learning to use the tools right
* Also Gregory Brown's Practicing Ruby mailing list has been valuable resource. Now released free one by one.


@codejitsiu The principles are much deeper than Smalltalk. I don't program any Smalltalk.

@jzw @chadfowler Nah, it's easier just to look at code than it is to look at CVs. I wouldn't care if the code is good. 37s had CS mjrs.

@nzkoz @svenfuchs It's not as readable as the other too, but still great. I would have loved a cliff notes version at 1/3 the length.

@resetexistence Great book, just not really about the nitty gritty in the same way that those other three are.

@daLizard Not a big fan of that one. I found it almost unreadable. Too abstract.

@galtenberg Design Patterns-style patterns don't seem to be doing much for me in the daily work.

@sryche Haven't read either of those. Will read Clean Code though.

@softcraft I didn't like that one at all. Far too abstract to me.

@rgeary I did, some nice lessons there, but not enough OOP wisdom.

@sbartholomew It's a great book, but it doesn't teach you the nitty gritty stuff. More high level.

@cearny Fantastic book, but didn't really move my core programming skills. But highly recommended. Rails is based on lots of that.

@icidAsset That a single method stays at the same level of abstraction. Not jumping back and forth between high and low level code.

It's pretty sad that I can only point to 3 books that really moved my core programming skills forward. We need more material here.

@marcellanz I haven't. Ruby was close enough and more practical for what I wanted to program. But so much strong thinking came from it.

@chadfowler I'd unfortunately say that's generally true as well. We need software craftsmen schools.

Three books you can get from Amazon that helped me become a better programmer: http://amzn.to/hOcQLT

Also, I haven't seen a strong correlation between a CS education and great OOP skills. They may teach the science, but not the art (writing)
Wed Mar 23 2011 21:19:05 (EET) via Tweetie for Mac
Also, by fundamentals I don't mean "can write bubblesort". I mean OOP fundamentals. Small methods, abstraction parity, class extraction, etc

@davenicolette I was saying that many great writers, not programmers, only know English. As in you don't have to know tons of prog langs.
Wed Mar 23 2011 21:12:31 (EET) via Tweetie for Mac in reply to davenicolette
But too many programmers do not have the fundamentals down. Learning the language is just a step, expressing yourself well is the goal.

It's not even about teaching people to be worldly. There are plenty of great writers who only know English. Same w/ programmers.
Wed Mar 23 2011 21:09:08 (EET) via Tweetie for Mac
It's like trying to mold great writers by teaching them how to use all the functions of Microsoft Word.
Wed Mar 23 2011 21:08:16 (EET) via Tweetie for Mac
As an industry, we focus on teaching tools too much and not the fundamentals of programming: naming, abstraction, composition, etc.

Wish we could Matrix-style load all the lessons from @KentBeck's Smalltalk Best Practices: http://amzn.to/edvu0s into all programmers.

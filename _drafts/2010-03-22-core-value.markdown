"Never allow your clients to corrupt your values or integrity."

The worst thing that can possibly happen, more than having money difficulties, is to corrupt yourself by compromising on your values and integrity due to pressure from a bad client. I'm not saying to be inflexible! I'm saying that there are core values that will allow you to reach for excellence and achieve it. You won't know what those values are when you're starting out, but you can be informed by studying the successful results of others and internalizing that knowledge. Then when you're on a roll and doing great work for your clients, you will realize what those core values are. From that moment on, no matter how big the pressure is, you should not compromise. The more confident you are about your way of working, the easier it will be for you to sell your services and acquire quality clients. The last thing you ever want to do is to appear desperate -- at that point great clients will go away running and bad clients, those that will take the worst advantage of you will become very friendly! Never allow your clients to compromise you. Stick to your values and focus on success.

Asiakkaat tulee meille meidän työn laadun/nopeuden/tulosten jne. takia ja se laatu on synnytetty core valueilla. Jos annamme periksi, annamme periksi myös kilpailuetumme.

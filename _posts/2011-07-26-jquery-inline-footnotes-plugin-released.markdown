jQuery Inline Footnotes provides inline footnotes like this [^1].

This is the first release (1.0) of this simple plugin. It's implemented with CoffeeScript as a jQuery plugin.

[Code and usage instructions](https://github.com/vesan/jquery-inline-footnotes) can be found at GitHub and I set up a [minuscule site](http://vesavanska.com/jquery-inline-footnotes) with the README and an example.

Enjoy!

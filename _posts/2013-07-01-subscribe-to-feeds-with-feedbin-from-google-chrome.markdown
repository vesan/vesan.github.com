Google Reader is shutting down so I looked my choices and decided to go with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.me). I wanted to subscribe to feeds from Google Chrome and finding the way to add Feedbin to Google Chrome's feed reader list took some time so here is the process with pictures.

1. Open a feed in Google Chrome.

2. Select "Manage…" from the drop down. ![Select "Manage…"](/images/2013/feedbin-1.png)

4. Write a description and in the URL field write **https://feedbin.me/?%s** ![Write description and URL](/images/2013/feedbin-2.png)

5. Click "Save".

Now you have Feedbin in your feed reader list and you can easily subscribe to feeds.

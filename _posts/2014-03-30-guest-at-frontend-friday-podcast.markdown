If you understand Finnish, you can enjoy an episode of the Frontend Friday podcast with the theme of Hypermedia APIs. I was happy to be invited to discuss about what Hypermedia APIs are, why I find them interesting, how would you start implementing them and other Hypermedia API related topics.

You can download the episode and view the shownotes at [the Frontend Friday website](http://ouluweb.github.io/podcast/2014/03/16/Episodi-10.html).

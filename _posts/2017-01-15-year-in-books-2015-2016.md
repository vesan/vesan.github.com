Last year I missed the posting of the yearly reading update so this post covers both 2015 and 2016.

I managed to hit my reading goals and they were also good reading years in quality.

In 2015 I read 82 books (24 of them comics) and in 2016 read 65 books (20 of them comics). In 2016 I also started doing lot more re-reading of previously read books or parts of them.

## Books with 5 stars

I'm not a literary critic and don't know which books are good or bad so I give my stars according to my own feeling on how much I got out of the book and how big of an impact I estimate it having on my life.

Here's the list:

- [Leap First: Creating Work That Matters](http://www.soundstrue.com/store/leap-first-1.html) by Seth Godin
- [Moominpappa at Sea](http://amzn.to/2iuOhXA) by Tove Jansson
- [Joustava mieli - Vapaudu stressin, uupumuksen ja masennuksen yliotteesta](https://verkkokauppa.duodecim.fi/6361.html) by Arto Pietik√§inen *in Finnish*
- [The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth](http://amzn.to/1WBz315) by M. Scott Peck
- [Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of NIKE](http://amzn.to/2iAgQWR) by Phil Knight
- [Siddhartha](http://amzn.to/2jm2lXR) by Hermann Hesse

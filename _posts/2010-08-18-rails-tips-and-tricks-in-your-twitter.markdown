[Apidock](http://apidock.com) is a site where you can search and read the documentation of Ruby, Ruby on Rails and RSpec. It also allows users to add notes to parts of the documentation. These notes often include interesting tips, gotchas, and cornercases discovered while using the documented features.

So how is this any way related to Twitter? Apidock has a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/apidock) where it posts links to all new notes added. Messages include the class and method the note has been added to, so you can easily see if there might be something interesting for you to read. Go check it out!

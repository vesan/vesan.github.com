Kippt is a service to save, search and share the stuff from the web. I started working on a Ruby gem to use the [Kippt API](https://kippt.com/developers/) while being at the [Railsberry conference](http://railsberry.com/) and released the gem few months ago.

[Kippt's team got accepted](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/yc-backed-kippt-goes-collaborative/) to Y Combinatorâ€™s Summer 2012 batch. To celebrate this I took the time today to get rid of some of the sharp edges of the library and improve the test suite.

I'm also calling it stable and releasing the 1.0. Documentation and code can be found on the [project's Github page](https://github.com/vesan/kippt). Check it out!

I gave a presentation about the interplay of validations and callbacks when persisting objects using ActiveRecord at [Helsinki Ruby Brigade event](http://rubybrigade.fi/post/47525509116/may-2013) 13th of May. The presentation concentrated on inconsistencies of the API and best practices on using ActiveRecord persistence that I feel need more publicity among Rails developers.

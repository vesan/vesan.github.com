Two weeks I gave a talk at Euruko 2022 on trunk-based development with the full title of From massive pull requests to trunk-based development.

Here is the talk description:

> Massive, long-lived pull requests are often such a headache. In this session we go through a move into a trunk-based development source-control workflow which eliminates the need for these “code avalanche” pull requests.
>
> After short introduction of trunk-based development and the fears people have for implementing it, we will go through concrete examples, lifted from a production system, of code, architecture, and workflows to tackle those fears when working on improving the development and deployment happiness of the team working on the application.
>
> After this talk the attendee are emboldened to start their own trunk-based development journey or excited to apply some of the techniques from the talk to their existing development processes and codebases.

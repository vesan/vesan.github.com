title: Blog posts are not blogs
tags: [nitpicking]

Time for some nitpicking. Blog posts are not blogs. Saying "I wrote a new blog" doesn't make sense. You are talking about a blog post (or article if you prefer). Blog is the place where you publish your blog posts.

It seems this battle is already lost, so many internet-savvy people are already using the word wrong let alone web beginners. The new meaning might be here to stay so this short blog post is my last battlecry before starting to reprogram my brain for the new meaning.

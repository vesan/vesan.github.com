Kippt released their [new developer site](http://developers.kippt.com/) and announced their new API stable some time ago. Kippt gem version 2.0 supports all the new APIs. It's also features refactoring to make the code better and enhancements for making the usage more streamlined.

Documentation and code can be found on the [project's Github page](https://github.com/vesan/kippt). Check it out!
